# Client App — User Onboarding

Landing page, broker quiz, and USDC payment flow. Users discover which broker fits their risk profile and deposit USDC to activate it.

## User flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Landing] --> B[Find Your Broker quiz]
    B -->|5 questions| C[Broker recommended]
    C --> D[/activate/steady]
    D -->|Connect MetaMask| E[Arc Testnet]
    E -->|Pay USDC| F[Broker wallet]
    F -->|POST /activate| G[Backend notified]
    G -->|WebSocket broadcast| H[Dashboard shows activation]
    H --> I[View Live Dashboard]
```

## What happens after payment

When a user pays, the client sends the transaction hash to the backend (`POST /activate`). The dashboard receives a WebSocket event and shows the activation in the "Recent Activations" panel — connecting the two apps in real time.

## Broker profiles

8 brokers, matched to user answers:

| Broker | Profile | Monthly cost | Risk |
|--------|---------|-------------|------|
| Guardian | Conservative | ~$3 | Low |
| Sentinel | Conservative | ~$5 | Low |
| Steady | Balanced | ~$10 | Medium |
| Navigator | Balanced | ~$15 | Medium |
| Growth | Growth | ~$25 | Med-High |
| Momentum | Growth | ~$35 | Med-High |
| Apex | Alpha | ~$50 | High |
| Titan | Alpha | ~$75 | High |

All broker metadata (APY, risk, cost, providers) is stored in ENS text records on `flowbroker.eth` and read at runtime.

## Wallet integration

Uses RainbowKit + wagmi configured for Arc Testnet (chain ID 5042002). The payment calls `transfer(address, uint256)` on USDC (`0x3600...`) to the broker's wallet on Arc.

```bash
# Add Arc Testnet to MetaMask
Chain ID: 5042002
RPC: https://rpc.testnet.arc.network
Symbol: USDC
Explorer: https://testnet.arcscan.app
```

## Run locally

```bash
cd client
npm install
